# runnergame-canvas

I just spent 5 hours coding a running game by using Canvas(HTML5). Both the game design and coding were done by myself, which in order to practice how to control a running person by our keyboard, because the time limits, some colors and pictures are a little bit ugly, so please forgive me, hahaha, if you want, just clone it and design by yourself. 

How to play the game:
(1) Open the html file from the web page. The game will start directly, you can see the timer, racetrack and other competitors. If you want to add a start button or some delay load event, just clone this file and just do it!

(2) You can use the "<-" and "->" button on your keyboard to control the runner.  You should press these two buttons alternately, more faster you press, more faster the runner will run. But once you press "<-" or "->" button more than two times in a row, the runner's speed will return to zero, which means you should increase the speed again from the very beginning.

(3) If you are the first one to cross the finish line. The top left corner will show the "Winner" text, otherwise it will show "Loser" text. And once the runner cross the finish line, it will run automatically, and the game is over.

(4) Just reload the web page or press "F5" to play again.

Finally, I just want my firend, you, to help me optimize this game. Whatever help, thank you so much. ^.^
